# Learn Dijkstra Algorithm

> Procedule
```
1. JSON File to Object-Array(Data Model)

2. Algorithm

3. Save into QUEUE

```

> Algorithm
```
1. Which point is closest to Startpoint

2. How many point near by point

3. Which path cost last

4. put the point into queue and remove from Array

5. begin from step-2
